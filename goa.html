                <p class="place-detail">Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea.
                     Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved 17th-century churches
                      and the area’s tropical spice plantations. Goa is also known for its beaches, 
                    ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda
                </p>
                <p class="place-detail">
                    Goa is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the region known as the Konkan,
                     and geographically separated from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats. It is surrounded 
                     by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian 
                     Sea forming its western coast. It is India's smallest state by area 
                     and its fourth-smallest by population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita 
                     among all Indian states,two and a half times as high as the GDP per capita of the country as a whole.
                     The Eleventh Finance Commission of India named Goa the best-placed state because of its infrastructure,
                      and India’s National Commission on Population rated it as having the best quality of life in India
